A (hopefully adequate) application of Zermelo's theorem for a math project :DD

<img width="800" alt="Screenshot 2025-03-27 at 9 56 25 AM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/adc8a7cf-42f0-4ace-bc9a-5ea3599b227a" />

Zermelo's theorem can be applied to tic-tac-toe since it:
- Involves two players
- Provides the complete game state to both players
- Has alternating moves between players
- Has a finite number of possible positions and moves
- Has no random element
- Has only three outcomes: win, lose, or tie

Therefore, in any game of tic-tac-toe, either player can play perfectly to either force a win or tie.

```bash
bun data
# cd src/data && g++ main.cpp -O3 && ./a.out && rm ./a.out

bun install
bun dev # Next frontend

bun tree # Image server (requires python, sets up .venv and installs dependencies)
```

`/src/data/boards.json` is tracked for smoother ci/cd although I realize that combinations could've been generated by Next while building...

Oh well yk good time to install GCC if you don't have it already :>

Board positions are stored in unsigned 32-bit integers where:
- Cells are blocks of 2 bits, using 18 of the 32 bits.
- The 18 blocks are stored right to left, top to bottom on the rightmost bits of the integer.
- `01` is X, `10` is O, `00` notates an empty cell.

For example:
```
000000000000010000001000000001
         1: -^   2: ^-   3: -^

1: X, Top Left
2: O, Middle Left
3: X, Bottom Right

X··
O··
··X
```

The "meat" of everything is in `/src/app/[[...positions]]/page.tsx`; board positions are slugs in the order of moves made. Enjoy!!
